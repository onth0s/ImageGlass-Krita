#
# Package the prebuilt Linux build of ImageGlass for Flatpak.
#
#   1. Tars the publish output (__artifacts/publish/linux-x64) into a release
#      archive, stripping debug symbols.
#   2. Writes the download URL + sha256 into the Flatpak manifest.
#   3. If flatpak-builder is available: builds a single-file .flatpak bundle
#      (for direct download / GitHub Releases) and installs it locally to test.
#
# Run after the publish-linux-x64 task. Distribution steps: __assets/linux/flatpak/README.md
#
# Env overrides:
#   RELEASE_TAG=10.0.2.66-beta-2   tag used to build the GitHub download URL
#                                  (defaults to <IgVersion>-<IgReleaseType>)
#   GPG_KEY=<keyid>       sign the .flatpak bundle with this GPG key and embed its
#                         public half so the signature is verifiable on install
#                         (optional; unset => unsigned bundle)
